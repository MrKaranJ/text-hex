# Text to Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal

Different number systems have been used in computer systems to store information. Even modern systems rely on the use of the binary system to store data. This simple program converts a given string into it's [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number), [octal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal) and [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) equivalent which are systems of base 2, 8 and 16 respectively. Use the links to access more information about these systems and their applications.

An example of the manual conversion from one system to another is shown below. Here we illustrate how to convert from the decimal system that is commonly used to the hexadecimal system.
